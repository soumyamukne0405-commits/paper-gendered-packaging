Abstract: This paper examines how packaging design in India’s personal care product market reinforces traditional gender stereotypes and contributes to gender-based price disparities, commonly called the "pink tax." Through a qualitative visual and textual semiotic analysis of two product sets—Nivea Men and Nivea Women deodorants, and Gillette Mach3 and Gillette Venus razors—the study investigates how colour schemes, typography, imagery, and language encode gendered messages and perpetuate cultural norms. Framed by Judith Butler’s theory of gender performativity and Roland Barthes’ semiotics, the research also contextualises these practices within India’s rapidly evolving consumer culture, which straddles traditional values and emerging gender-neutral movements. Findings reveal clear, persistent patterns: male-oriented products emphasise strength, endurance, and performance, while female-oriented products foreground beauty, delicacy, and luxury, often at higher price points despite functional similarities. These observations contribute to ongoing critiques of gendered marketing and offer insights for design professionals and policymakers addressing gender equity in consumer spaces.































Keywords: gendered packaging, pink tax, personal care, semiotics, gender performativity. 

Introduction 
Personal and wellness items are important in daily routines within India's changing and varied consumer environment. Those products, including skincare, haircare, deodorants, as well as grooming supplies, serve practical needs, plus also convey social ideas. Gendered packaging happens where marketing plans meet cultural norms. That is the intentional use of visual and wording choices in product appearance to attract particular gender identities. As a very direct and obvious element of a product, packaging has an important job in forming consumer thoughts, subtly supporting societal standards next to affecting purchase choices. Font style, images, in addition to language, related to packaging often mirror plus continue old gender stereotypes in the market.
In India, this issue is more important because old cultural expectations about gender are present with quickly changing ideas of identity and self-expression. Though talk about inclusivity and representation in media plus advertising is expanding, the personal care business in India continues to use highly gendered marketing plans. Items for men often use dark, noticeable colour sets, firm font styles, along with images showing power, athleticism, as well as toughness. In contrast, items for women usually have light shades, fine fonts, flower patterns next to language focusing on beauty, softness, in addition to tenderness. The effect of these packaging choices goes past just setting apart items. They insert and strengthen cultural stories about gender roles, and appeal along with social identity.
The "pink tax" is a related result of marketing practices focused on gender. It is a financial difference. Products for women tend to cost more than similar products for men. This happens even if they function the same, are made of the same stuff, or cost the same to make. This happens across the globe. How packaging design causes this price difference in India is less known in research papers.
This paper examines the intersection of gender, packaging design, and pricing practices within India's personal care industry through a close analysis of two representative product sets: Nivea Men and Nivea Women deodorants, and Gillette Mach3 and Gillette Venus razors. Drawing on Butler's theory of gender performativity and Barthes' semiotics, the study investigates how packaging encodes and circulates gendered meanings, contributing to the market. 


































1. Gender and Consumer Culture

1.1 Theoretical Foundations: Gender as Performance
Judith Butler's seminal work, Gender Trouble: Feminism and the Subversion of Identity, introduces the concept of gender performativity, asserting that gender is not an innate quality but rather an identity constituted through repeated social performances. Butler posits that these performances are regulated by societal norms and expectations, leading individuals to internalize and enact behaviours deemed appropriate for their assigned gender. This framework is pivotal in understanding how consumer products, particularly in the personal care industry, utilize packaging design elements to signal and reinforce gender norms.
Building upon Butler's theory, the concept of "doing gender," as articulated by West and Zimmerman, emphasizes that gender is an ongoing activity achieved through daily interactions and behaviours. In the context of consumer culture, this perspective suggests that individuals "do" gender through their choices and use of gendered products, which are often designed and marketed to align with societal expectations of masculinity and femininity. (“Doing Gender,” 2025)

1.2 Gender Representation in Indian Advertising
In the Indian context, advertising plays a significant role in shaping and perpetuating gender norms. A comprehensive study conducted by UNICEF and the Geena Davis Institute analysed 1,000 of the most-viewed Indian advertisements on television and YouTube in 2019. The findings revealed that female characters were predominantly portrayed in domestic settings, often depicted as caregivers or homemakers, while male characters were more frequently shown in professional or authoritative roles. Such portrayals reinforce traditional gender roles and influence consumer perceptions and behaviours. 
Further analysis highlighted that female characters were nine times more likely to be shown as "stunning/very attractive" compared to male characters, emphasizing physical appearance as a primary attribute for women in advertising. Additionally, a significant proportion of female characters had lighter skin tones, perpetuating colourism and narrow beauty






























standards. These representations not only reflect societal biases but also impact consumer expectations and preferences, influencing the design and marketing of personal care products. (Gender Bias and Inclusion in Advertising in India Report: UNICEF, n.d.)

1.3 Implications for Personal Care Product Packaging
The interplay between gender performativity and advertising practices has direct implications for the packaging of personal care products in India. Packaging design elements such as colour schemes, typography, and imagery are strategically employed to align with culturally constructed gender norms. For instance, products targeted at women often feature pastel colours, elegant fonts, and images emphasizing beauty and delicacy, while those aimed at men utilize bold colours, strong typography, and imagery associated with strength and ruggedness.
These design choices not only cater to gendered consumer preferences but also reinforce and perpetuate traditional gender stereotypes. Moreover, the differentiation in packaging and marketing strategies contributes to observed pricing disparities between products marketed to men and women, commonly referred to as the "pink tax." Understanding the cultural and theoretical underpinnings of gender representation in consumer culture is thus essential for analysing the role of packaging design in reinforcing gender norms and contributing to economic inequalities in the Indian personal care market.


2. Packaging as a Semiotic Device
Packaging serves not only as a protective container for products but also as a powerful communication tool that conveys messages about the product's identity, quality, and intended consumer. In the realm of personal care products, packaging design elements—such as colour schemes, typography, imagery, and language—are strategically employed to signal gender associations, thereby influencing consumer perceptions and purchasing behaviours.

































2.1 Gender Representation Through Packaging Design
Magdalena Petersson McIntyre's study, "Gender by Design: Performativity and Consumer Packaging," utilizes visual ethnography to analyse how mass-produced packaging perpetuates gender norms. The research reveals that packaging often embodies and communicates societal expectations of femininity and masculinity. For instance, products targeted at women frequently feature pastel colours, cursive fonts, and imagery emphasizing beauty and delicacy, while those aimed at men employ bold colours, blocky typography, and motifs associated with strength and ruggedness. These design choices not only reflect but also reinforce traditional gender roles, making packaging a co-creator of gendered realities. (McIntyre, M. P, n.d.)

2.2 Consumer Perceptions of Gendered Packaging
Isabel Nelson's research, "Is the Future of Personal Care Product Packaging Gender Neutral?" investigates consumer perceptions of gendered packaging among Generation Z and Generation X in Helsinki. Through focus group discussions, the study found that while both generations recognize the prevalence of gendered packaging, Generation Z participants exhibited a stronger preference for gender-neutral designs. Participants expressed that gendered packaging often feels restrictive and reinforces outdated stereotypes. They favoured packaging that focuses on product functionality and quality over gender-specific aesthetics. (Nelson, 2022)
Although this study is based in a Western context, its findings are increasingly relevant to the Indian market, where urban consumers, particularly younger demographics, are becoming more conscious of gender inclusivity and are seeking products that align with their values. This shift in consumer attitudes presents an opportunity for brands in India to reconsider traditional gendered packaging strategies.


3. Stereotypes in Product Marketing































3.1 Reinforcement of Gender Norms Through Packaging Design
Packaging design plays a pivotal role in conveying and reinforcing societal gender norms. Giorgia Lombardo's article, "Sexist Design: How Gendered Packaging Reinforces Gender Stereotypes and Toxic Masculinity," critically examines how packaging elements perpetuate traditional gender roles. Lombardo highlights that products targeted at men often feature bold colours, aggressive typography, and assertive language, emphasizing strength and dominance. Conversely, products aimed at women frequently utilize soft colours, delicate fonts, and language that underscores beauty and gentleness. These design choices not only reflect but also reinforce societal expectations of masculinity and femininity, influencing consumer perceptions and behaviours. (Giorgia Lombardo | UX Collective, n.d.)
In the Indian context, such gendered packaging is prevalent in personal care products. For instance, fairness creams for women often come in pink or white packaging with floral designs, emphasizing beauty and purity, whereas men's grooming products like deodorants and shaving gels are packaged in dark colours with angular designs, highlighting masculinity and strength. These design elements serve as visual cues that guide consumer choices based on gendered expectations.

3.2 Cultural Influences on Gendered Packaging
Rui Huang's paper, "Packaging Design of Objects from a Gendered Cultural Perspective," delves into how cultural norms and gender theories influence packaging design. The study emphasizes that packaging is not merely a marketing tool but also a medium that reflects and shapes societal gender constructs. Huang argues that traditional packaging often adheres to binary gender representations, which can marginalize non-conforming identities. The paper advocates for a shift towards gender-neutral packaging designs that cater to a diverse consumer base and promote inclusivity. (Huang, 2023) 
In India, where cultural norms heavily influence consumer behaviour, packaging designs that challenge traditional gender roles can contribute to broader societal change. By adopting inclusive design practices, brands can appeal to a wider audience and foster a more equitable marketplace.

































4. Pink Tax and Gendered Pricing in India

4.1 Understanding the Pink Tax Phenomenon
The "pink tax" refers to the phenomenon where products and services marketed towards women are priced higher than similar or identical items targeted at men. This pricing disparity is not due to differences in product quality or production costs but is often attributed to gender-based marketing strategies and societal norms. In India, this issue is gaining attention as studies reveal significant differences in perceptions and experiences related to the pink tax among men and women. (Biswas et al., n.d.) 
 
4.2 Legal Perspectives on the Pink Tax in India
The legal framework in India currently lacks specific provisions addressing gender-based pricing disparities. An article published in the International Journal of Legal and Law Research examines the legal aspects of the pink tax in India, discussing its implications on economic equality. The study emphasizes the need for legislative measures to address this form of economic discrimination and promote consumer rights. (IJLLR, 2025) 

4.3 Societal Implications and the Need for Change
The pink tax not only imposes a financial burden on women but also reinforces traditional gender roles and stereotypes. By pricing products differently based on gender-targeted packaging and marketing, companies perpetuate the notion that femininity is a luxury requiring additional expenditure. Addressing these disparities requires a multifaceted approach, including consumer awareness, corporate responsibility, and legal reforms.


5. Emerging Gender-Neutral and Inclusive Branding Trends
































5.1 The Shift Towards Gender-Neutral Branding
In recent years, there has been a notable shift in the branding strategies of fashion, cosmetic, and fragrance companies, moving away from traditional gender-specific branding to embrace more inclusive, gender-neutral approaches. This transition is driven by a desire to connect with a new generation of consumers who value authenticity and inclusivity. Brands are recognizing that rigid gender norms are becoming obsolete, and there is a growing demand for products that cater to a diverse consumer base without reinforcing outdated stereotypes. 

5.2 The Rise of Gender-Neutral Grooming Products
The grooming industry, traditionally segmented by gender, is experiencing a transformation with the emergence of gender-neutral products. Historically, beauty and skincare products were predominantly marketed towards women, leading to the stereotype that skincare is not for men. However, societal norms are evolving, and there is an increased consumer demand for inclusivity. Brands like Milk Makeup and Non - Gender specific are at the forefront of this movement, offering products that embrace diversity and cater to non-binary identities. This shift not only challenges traditional marketing strategies but also promotes a more inclusive approach that allows everyone to feel free in their self-care routines. (Cheng, 2019)

5.3 Implications for the Indian Market
In the Indian context, the adoption of gender-neutral and inclusive branding presents both challenges and opportunities. While traditional gender norms remain influential, there is a growing segment of consumers, particularly among younger demographics, who are receptive to inclusive branding. Brands operating in India can leverage this shift by developing products and marketing strategies that transcend traditional gender boundaries, thereby appealing to a broader audience and promoting gender equity in the marketplace.



































6. Visual Content Analysis

6.1 Nivea Men vs. Nivea Women Deodorants
An analysis of Nivea Men and Nivea Women deodorant packaging reveals clear visual distinctions that reinforce traditional gender stereotypes through design. The colour schemes used on these products differ starkly: Nivea Men’s deodorants predominantly employ dark, bold colours such as navy blue, black, and silver, colours traditionally associated with strength, power, and masculinity. In contrast, Nivea Women’s deodorants feature lighter, softer tones, including white, pink, and pastel shades, hues culturally linked with softness, purity, and femininity. This dichotomy in colour schemes reinforces societal expectations, suggesting through visual language that men should embody strength and dominance, while women should represent delicacy and beauty.
Typography choices on the products further emphasize these traditional gender roles. Nivea Men deodorants employ bold, uppercase fonts with sharp edges, conveying a sense of robustness, assertiveness, and directness. Nivea Women products, on the other hand, use softer, rounded fonts, often in lowercase, which evoke feelings of gentleness, care, and approachability. This typographic contrast reinforces conventional notions of masculinity as powerful and commanding, while femininity is framed as nurturing and graceful.
Visual imagery on the packaging also aligns with these stereotypes. Nivea Men products frequently feature dynamic graphic elements such as metallic textures and active lines that suggest energy, performance, and athleticism, connoting an active, resilient male identity. In contrast, Nivea Women products incorporate imagery associated with beauty and personal care, such as floral motifs, pearls, and smooth textures, emphasizing aesthetics, delicacy, and luxury. This choice of imagery communicates an idealized, beauty-conscious version of femininity, positioning women’s deodorants as beauty-enhancing rather than merely functional.
The language and naming conventions used on these deodorants mirror the visual codes. Nivea Men product names include phrases such as "Cool Kick," "Fresh Active," and "Silver Protect," which highlight action, performance, and protection. Conversely, Nivea Women deodorants are named "Pearl & Beauty," "Fresh Natural," and "Whitening Smooth Skin," emphasizing beauty, naturalness, and skin enhancement. These verbal cues reinforce gender norms by associating men’s products with active utility and defence, while women’s products focus on appearance, scent, and skin perfection.



































6.2 Gillette Mach3 vs. Gillette Venus Razors
The comparison of Gillette Mach3 and Gillette Venus razors further illustrates how packaging design elements visually and verbally reinforce traditional gender norms within India’s personal wellness market. Gillette Mach3 razors are dominated by dark, bold colours such as black, grey, and metallic blue, symbolizing strength, precision, and a sleek, modern masculinity. In contrast, Gillette Venus razors feature pastel shades like pink, lavender, and turquoise, colours conventionally associated with softness, beauty, and femininity. This stark difference in colour palettes immediately signals to consumers the gendered positioning of these products.
Typography choices also reflect this divide. Gillette Mach3 packaging utilizes bold, sans-serif fonts with sharp, angular lines, suggesting technical expertise, precision, and no-nonsense functionality. Gillette Venus packaging, however, employs elegant, flowing fonts that suggest grace, indulgence, and beauty, contributing to an overall aesthetic designed to appeal to culturally embedded ideas of femininity.
The visual imagery on these razor packages further differentiates their gendered appeals. Gillette Mach3 designs feature sleek metallic finishes and streamlined graphic elements that evoke technology, speed, and control. By contrast, Gillette Venus incorporates curvaceous forms, water droplet motifs, and floral imagery to evoke softness, smoothness, and luxury. These visual cues align with gendered expectations, presenting men's razors as high-performance tools and women's razors as beauty accessories designed for indulgence and aesthetic enhancement.
Lastly, the language and product naming conventions reinforce these roles. Gillette Mach3 razors use product names such as "Turbo," "Sensitive," and "Power," all of which emphasize speed, efficiency, and utility. In contrast, Gillette Venus uses product names like "Embrace," "Swirl," and "Spa Breeze," highlighting pleasure, pampering, and luxury. These naming choices contribute to a narrative in which men’s grooming products focus on function and performance, while women’s products promise beauty, sensory delight, and indulgence. 
































Conclusion 
This research explored how packaging design elements in India’s personal care product industry reinforce traditional gender stereotypes and contribute to gender-based price disparities, commonly termed the "pink tax." Through a visual and textual semiotic analysis of two representative product pairs — Nivea Men and Nivea Women deodorants, and Gillette Mach3 and Gillette Venus razors — this study revealed persistent patterns in color schemes, typography, imagery, and language that code products along culturally constructed gender lines. Male-oriented products emphasized strength, performance, and utility, while female-oriented products highlighted beauty, delicacy, and luxury, often accompanied by higher price points despite offering functionally similar outcomes.
Framed within Judith Butler's theory of gender performativity and Roland Barthes’ semiotics, the findings underscore how personal care packaging in India continues to be a site where gender norms are visually and verbally constructed, circulated, and internalized. The analysis further demonstrated that these practices contribute to market segmentation and economic disparities through gendered pricing strategies.
However, this review-based study has limitations. Primarily, it relies on secondary literature, existing market reports, and general observations without incorporating primary consumer data or market analytics. While it successfully maps established semiotic patterns and historical marketing strategies, it does not account for individual consumer interpretations, purchasing behaviours, or evolving preferences in real-time contexts, especially within India’s rapidly diversifying urban markets. Additionally, the sample size for visual content analysis was deliberately narrow — focusing on two well-established brands — which, while illustrative, may not represent the full scope of the personal wellness industry in India.
Despite these limitations, this study contributes to the ongoing academic and industry conversations on gendered marketing and consumer equity, offering actionable insights for designers, marketers, and policymakers working towards more inclusive and ethically responsible branding practices in India’s personal care sector.
